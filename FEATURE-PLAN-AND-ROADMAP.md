# JLib Inspector - Feature Plan and Roadmap

## Vision Statement

**JLib Inspector aims to be the definitive solution for Java dependency visibility and security governance in production environments.**

Our vision is to transform how organizations understand, monitor, and secure their Java applications by providing real-time, comprehensive visibility into JAR dependencies and their actual runtime usage. We envision a future where security vulnerabilities like Log4Shell can be assessed and addressed within minutes rather than days, where dependency optimization is data-driven rather than guesswork, and where Java application governance is proactive rather than reactive.

JLib Inspector will evolve from a monitoring tool into a comprehensive dependency intelligence platform that empowers developers, security teams, and operations to make informed decisions about their Java ecosystem with confidence and speed.
